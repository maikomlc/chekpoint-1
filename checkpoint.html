        Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist artist whose paintings are among the most popular and recognizable in history. His dramatic brushwork, vibrant color palette, and mastery at capturing light and emotion revolutionized art.

        Only recognized near the end of his life, Van Gogh's struggles and triumphs have shaped our understanding of what it means to be an artist. Works like <em>Sunflowers</em>, <em>Café Terrace at Night</em>, and <em>The Starry Night</em> have become iconic—representing not only his unique vision, but the entire post-impressionist movement.

        Van Gogh's life was marked by poverty, mental health challenges, and isolation. Despite these hardships, he created around 870 oil paintings along with countless sketches and watercolors. His letters, especially to his brother Theo, give us a heartfelt and often heartbreaking glimpse into his inner world.

        Theo supported Vincent both financially and emotionally, maintaining a rich correspondence. Over 650 of Vincent's letters survive today, along with 41 of Theo’s replies. These writings, often including sketches, give rare insights into Van Gogh’s creative process and personal life.

        Additionally, Van Gogh created 43 self-portraits, offering another window into his evolving identity as an artist. Together, his artworks and writings offer us multiple perspectives on his genius, beyond just paint on canvas.
